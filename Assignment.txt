The makefile should produce the README.md which should contain the following information:

The title of the project.

The date and time at which make was run.

The number of lines of code contained in guessinggame.sh.

The README.md should be produced entirely from the makefile and should not be edited by hand.

README.md: guessinggame.sh
  echo "The number of lines of code contained in guessinggame.sh" > README.md
  wc -l guessinggame.sh | egrep -o "[0-9]+" >> README.md

clean:
  rm README.md
